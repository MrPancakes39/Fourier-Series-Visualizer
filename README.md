A tool to help visualize any Fourier Series / Discrete Fourier Transform.

Each term of the series / sequence is represented using circles.

### Custom Curve Guide:

- Terms in the series are denoted by the letter '**k**'.
- To use only odd terms you may use '**(2*k)+1**'.
- Similarly to use only even terms you may use '**(2*k)**'.
- The Amplitude in the series is denoted by '**A**'.
- To use Ï€ you can input '**PI**'.
- The Equation to the left shows the form that will be computed.

### Upload Path Guide:

- This is used for you to upload your own custom path.
- The path is an array of numbers in a JSON file.
- An example is 'test/drawing.json' in the repo.
